Here's how this packet sniffer tool will work:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes by importing the necessary modules, including Scapy for packet manipulation.
  
2. **Packet Sniffing**: It starts sniffing network packets using Scapy's `sniff` function, specifying the network interface and filtering criteria if needed.

3. **Packet Analysis**: When a packet is captured, the program extracts relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data.

4. **Display**: It displays the extracted information in a user-friendly format, such as printing it to the console.

5. **Error Handling**: Error handling is implemented to gracefully handle any exceptions that may occur during packet sniffing or analysis, ensuring the stability of the program.

With these steps, this packet sniffer tool will effectively capture and analyze network packets, giving you valuable insights into network traffic for monitoring and analysis purposes.
